              or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief,

              arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by
              a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American
              Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected
              by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
              The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered
              upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any
              legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of
              or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall
              be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
              The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards
              to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result
              of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly,
              including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and
              Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act
              governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The
              entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this
              arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This
              arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms
              and Conditions.`}
